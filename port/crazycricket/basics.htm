means two things. </font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#006699" size="6">Batting</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
To use your bat to hit the ball and score as MANY runs as possible within a set 
amount of tries (also called balls) from the opposition to get you out.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5" color="#FFFFFF">After hitting the ball 
a batsman can run in-between the wickets (the wooden sticks on either side) and 
everytime they run between them they score a run!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#006699" size="6">Bowling</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
The goal is to get the batsman out by catching the ball after he/she hits or 
EVEN hitting his wickets with your ball. You can even run the batsman out which 
simply means you hit the wickets with the ball when they're running between the 
wickets to make a run and they don't get to the wicket fast enough.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="6" color="#006699">Fielding</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5" color="#FFFFFF">To stop the batters 
making runs and get the ball back to the middle as soon as possible before the 
ball goes ALL the way to the edge of the pitch (the boundary) where the batter 
makes extra runs if it does (a 4 and a six if it goes over without bouncing)!
</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5" color="#FFFFFF">A fielder can also 
catch the batter out if they catch the ball before it hits the floor after being 
hit by the batter.</font></b></p>
